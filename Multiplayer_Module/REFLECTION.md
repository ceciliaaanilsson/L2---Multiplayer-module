| Name and explanation | Reflection |
|----------------------|------------|
|**GameClient** - Class name in the module | **Avoid disinformation**: GameClient isn’t directly disinformation, but the name isn’t specific enough about what the class actually does. A more specific name could have been chosen since GameClient doesn’t provide much more information beyond the fact that it handles the game’s client. At the same time, I think it’s a good name because the intention of the module is for it to be used in a game, and everything the client handles happens there.|
|**GameCharacter** - Class name in the module| **Add meaningful context**: The class name tells you exactly what it does, but it gives too little information. My intention with GameCharacter is that it should be extended, and you should be able to create a custom game character, which is not apparent from the name. The user won’t think of that when they first see the name but will only realize it later when reading the documentation. A better name could have been something like ‘BaseCharacter’ or ‘BasePlayer’.|
|**setupWebsocket()** - Method in GameClient|**Use Intention-Revealing Names**: A method name should clearly convey what the method does. The name **setupWebsocket()** reveals that something related to WebSockets is being set up, but it’s not descriptive enough. It doesn’t provide any information about what exactly is being “set up”—whether it’s creating a connection, configuring a specific WebSocket instance, or setting up communication channels. **Avoid Disinformation**: The name **setupWebsocket()** could create false expectations. The word “setup” is too general and could suggest different things to different developers—whether it’s starting a server or creating a WebSocket instance. This can mislead other developers about the exact nature of the “setup,” which goes against the principle of avoiding misleading names. A more specific name describing exactly what is being set up would be more appropriate. |
|**handleMovement()** - Method in GameClient | **Use intention-revealing names**: Användaren får veta att metoden hanterar movement men inte mer än så. Metodnamnet borde vara mer beskrivande så användaren får veta mer. **Avoid disinformation**: När användaren inte får veta mer än att metoden hanterar movement blir det vilseledande. Då börjar användaren av klassen själv tänka på vad de är för movement som metoden ska hantera.|
|**GameServer** - Class name in the module | **Don't be cute**: **GameServer** is not actually a GameServer. It’s a WebSocket server. There’s not much in the class that directly connects it to a game, so it shouldn’t be named as such. It creates a WebSocket server that clients can connect to, which isn’t apparent from the name. I thought the name was appropriate at the time when the intention was to create a game module, but after further thought, descriptive names carry more weight. **Avoid disinformation**: Calling the class **GameServer** is downright misleading. It’s not a game server, so there’s no reason it should be named that.|
